# figure out how to read datasets efficiently and cleanly while making these
# summaries at the same time

# write final dataset into a file in rustcrn

# A dataset with one row for each station, providing information about the
# station identifier, station name, state, longitude, and latitude.

# The full daily dataset with the following columns:
#  • WBANNO, state, station name, LST_DATE, CRX_VN, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE,
#    T_DAILY_MAX, T_DAILY_MIN, T_DAILY_MEAN, T_DAILY_AVG, P_DAILY_CALC,
#    SOLARAD_DAILY
# Convert missing value codes into NAs. The date column should be in R’s date
# format. Be sure to document your dataset, explaining what each column means.
