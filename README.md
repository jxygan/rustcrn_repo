# rustcrn_repo

This is Joyce and Crystal's repository for our STSCI 4520 project, completed in Spring of 2024.
The repository contains a package analyzing data from the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN), data on weather stations maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It has functions for interpolating data throughout a map of the United States as well as generating predictions for annual temperature change for a certain weather station. 

We named it rstcrn_repo taking letters from R, USCRN, and Statistics.
