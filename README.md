# rustcrn_repo

This is Joyce and Crystal's repository for my 4520 project.
This is about a package analyzing data from the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN), data on weather stations maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

We named it rstcrn_repo taking letters from R , USCRN , and Statistics.
